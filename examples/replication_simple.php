// Predis supports master / slave replication scenarios where write operations
// are performed on the master server and read operations are executed against
// one of the slaves. The behavior of commands or EVAL scripts can be customized
// at will. As soon as a write operation is performed the client switches to the
// master server for all the subsequent requests (either reads and writes).
//
// This example must be executed using the second Redis server configured as the
// slave of the first one (see the "SLAVEOF" command).
//
