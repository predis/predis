// Example of FT.SUGADD, FT.SUGGET, FT.SUGDEL, FT.SUGLEN commands usage:

// 1. Add suggestion to key with payload
$client = new Client();

$client->ftsugadd('key', 'hello', 2, (new SugAddArguments())->payload('payload'));

echo 'Suggestions dictionary length: ' . $client->ftsuglen('key') . "\n";

// 2. Perform fuzzy search by prefix to get previous suggestion with payload
$response = $client->ftsugget('key', 'hellp', (new SugGetArguments())->fuzzy()->withPayloads());

echo 'Suggestion for "hellp" prefix:' . "\n";

// 3. Removes previous suggestion from key
$client->ftsugdel('key', 'hello');
$response = $client->ftsugget('key', 'hello');
