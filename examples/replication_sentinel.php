// Predis supports redis-sentinel to provide high availability in master / slave
// scenarios. The only but relevant difference with a basic replication scenario
// is that sentinel servers can manage the master server and its slaves based on
// their state, which means that they are able to provide an authoritative and
// updated configuration to clients thus avoiding static configurations for the
// replication servers and their roles.

// Instead of connection parameters pointing to redis nodes, we provide a list
// of instances of redis-sentinel. Users should always provide a timeout value
// low enough to not hinder operations just in case a sentinel is unreachable
// but Predis uses a default value of 100 milliseconds for sentinel parameters
// without an explicit timeout value.
//
// NOTE: in real-world scenarios sentinels should be running on different hosts!
